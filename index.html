            <h3 id="firstparagraph">A brief history of nottingham</h3>
            <p> So you’ve picked Nottingham as your university city and I bet you’ve heard of some of the cool shops, lively bars and great football teams 
                (ok maybe not great) but what do you actually know about the history of our great city? <br />
                I’m not just talking about the fact we had a national ice stadium and tore it down to build another one or the fact that we use to have a tram 
                system and… well… ripped it up and built another one. <br />
                Here are a few more nuggets of information about your new home... <br />
                  
                    6th century – A man called Snote proclaims a lot of land as his own and gives us Snottingham. <br />
                    
                    11th century – The Normans invade and bring with them the first wave of pretentious people to Snotts who decide the “S” is un-cool, 
                    leaving us with Nottingham. <br />
                    
                    12th century – The Normans try to make up for the invasion by building a load of abbeys and cathedrals, which have stood the test of time. 
                    The best example is Newstead Abbey, once home to the legendary poet Lord George Byron (he inherited it aged ten and it’s now worth £78 million, 
                    give or take). <br />
                    
                    17th Century – King Charles 1st cements the start of the civil war by raising his flag in the city of Nottingham. It was a sign he was about to 
                    embark on war. <br />
                    
                    19th century – William Booth was born who, along with his wife, founded the Salvation Army. They continue to do tons of work throughout the world
                     to help the poor. <br />
                    
                    20th Century- Nottingham born fashion designer Paul Smith opens his first shop in what is now The Tokenhouse on Bridlesmith Gate. I bet some of
                     you reading this are wearing his clothes. <br />
                    
                    21st century – You came to Nottingham to start the finest leg of your youth, masquerading as a student while actually submerging yourself in a 
                    lifestyle filled with vice and text messaging. <br />
